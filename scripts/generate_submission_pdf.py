        "Unlike traditional risk calculators, AstraMed leverages an advanced ensemble of Machine Learning models (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) combined with Generative AI "
        "to provide not just a risk score, but a personalized, explainable, and actionable health report. The system features a clinician-facing dashboard for deep analytics "
